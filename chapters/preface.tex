\chapter{Preface}

In the past few years at the University of Twente, I frequently chose to study subjects with an emphasis an practical applications.
It may be surprising then, that I chose to work on functional programming and type theory in this thesis.

For many, functional programming and type theory are far removed from practical applications.
First and foremost I want to thank Jan Kuper, my first supervisor, for giving me confidence when I needed it most, and providing direction when I felt lost.
